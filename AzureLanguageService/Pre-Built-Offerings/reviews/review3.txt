Beautiful property right on the beach with well-maintained gardens and a calm atmosphere. The staff were extremely courteous and always willing to help. The seafood restaurant was a highlight, serving fresh catches daily. Rooms were bright, airy, and cleaned thoroughly every day. Perfect place to unwind and disconnect.
