Charming hotel with character
Old Town Heritage Hotel, Prague, Czech Republic
18/4/2018
A lovely boutique hotel full of character and history. The room had traditional décor but modern amenities, including a very comfortable bed. Breakfast was served in a cozy dining room with plenty of options. The location in the old town is unbeatable, close to cafés, shops, and major sights. Highly recommended for couples.
