Excellent stay with a touch of luxury
The Grand Riverside Hotel, Paris, France
14/6/2019
Spacious rooms, attentive staff, and a stunning view of the Seine made our stay memorable. The breakfast buffet was generous with fresh pastries and local cheeses. The hotel is within walking distance of major attractions, yet quiet at night. Housekeeping was excellent and the concierge was very helpful with recommendations. Would happily stay here again.
