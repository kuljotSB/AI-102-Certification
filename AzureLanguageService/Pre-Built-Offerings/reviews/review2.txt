Comfortable and convenient
City Central Inn, Berlin, Germany
22/9/2020
The hotel is perfectly located near public transport, making it easy to explore the city. Rooms were clean, modern, and well soundproofed. Staff were friendly and efficient at check-in and check-out. While the rooms are compact, they are well designed and comfortable for a short stay. Great value for money.
