11/8/2022
Ideal hotel for business travel with fast Wi-Fi, a comfortable work desk, and excellent meeting facilities. The staff were professional and efficient throughout the stay. Rooms were spotless and well maintained. The gym and rooftop pool were a nice bonus after long workdays. Conveniently located near offices and dining options.
